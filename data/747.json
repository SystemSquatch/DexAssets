            "Sun": "It plunges the poison spike on its head into its prey. When the prey has weakened, Mareanie deals the finishing blow with its 10 tentacles.",
            "Moon": "It's found crawling on beaches and seafloors. The coral that grows on Corsola 's head is as good as a five-star banquet to this Pokémon.",
            "Ultra Sun": "They eat Corsola branches, so Mareanie are hated by craftsmen who work with Corsola branches that have naturally fallen off.",

* /data: Contains individual JSON files for each Pokémon. Each file includes:  
  * General information (Pokédex number, types, abilities)  
  * Base stats  
  * A complete list of Pokédex entries from various games  
  * Game locations  
  * A detailed evolution chain, including methods for every evolution path  
* /assets/images: Contains high-resolution (512x512) Pokémon HOME sprites for each Pokémon.

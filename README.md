# **Pokémon Data & Image Repository**

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of data and images for Pokémon, compiled for educational and personal use.

## License and Use

This repository aggregates data from two primary sources, each with its own terms:

* **Bulbapedia:** The majority of the data (stats, Pokédex entries, images, etc.) is sourced from Bulbapedia and is governed by the **Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 2.5 (CC BY-NC-SA 2.5)** license.
* **PokeAPI:** All evolution data is sourced from the free-to-use PokeAPI, which operates under its own fair use policy.

Because a primary data source explicitly forbids commercial use, the entire repository and any projects derived from it must be considered **strictly non-commercial**. By using this repository, you agree to respect the terms of both original sources.

## **Contents**

This repository is organized into two main directories:

* /data: Contains individual JSON files for each Pokémon. Each file includes:  
  * General information (Pokédex number, types, abilities)  
  * Base stats  
  * A complete list of Pokédex entries from various games  
  * Game locations  
  * A detailed evolution chain, including methods for every evolution path  
* /assets/home_sprites: Contains high-resolution (512x512) Pokémon HOME sprites for each Pokémon.

## **Data Sources and Attribution**

This project would not be possible without the incredible work of the teams behind Bulbapedia and PokeAPI. All data and images are sourced from these two platforms.
